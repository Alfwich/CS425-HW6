CS425: Homework 6/7
Cameron Hall, Arthur Wuterich

Algorithm Selection:
  TSP Branch and Bound Approach

Algorithm Explanation:
  Start with the cheapest path
  Repeat while tour is less than number of cities:
    Perform matrix align with initial cost matrix on path to find lower bound
    Find path(s) with cost equal to lower bound.
    Update the right cost matrix to include the cheapest path and cost.
    Compute new lower bound both including and excluding the chosen path.
    Repeat algorithm with the right path and updated cost matrix
